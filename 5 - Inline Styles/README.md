# Inline Styles

There are many different ways to use styles in React. This lesson is focused on one of them: *inline* styles.

An inline style is a style that’s written as an *attribute*, like this:

```
<h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world</h1>
```

Notice the double curly braces. What are those for?

The* outer* curly braces inject JavaScript into JSX. They say, “everything between us should be read as JavaScript, not JSX.”

The inner curly braces create a JavaScript object literal. They make this a valid JavaScript object:

```
{ color: 'red' }
```

If you inject an object literal into JSX, and your entire injection is *only* that object literal, then you will end up with double curly braces. There’s nothing unusual about how they work, but they look funny and can be confusing.
